# Contributing to Au

Thank you for your interest in Au: a C++ units library, by Aurora. We welcome your contributions!
Here are some guidelines to help.

## Contributor License Agreement (“CLA”)

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a signed CLA. You (or your employer) retain the
copyright to your contribution; the CLA merely gives us permission to use and redistribute your
contribution as part of the project. You'll automatically be prompted to sign the CLA the first time
you create a pull request.  You only need to sign it once.

> NOTE: If you're planning to make contributions on behalf of your employer or another entity,
> please sign the [corporate
> CLA](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdxFUhXe8cy5UMuu4cBQH_SPam0aQ5Yrxw0W8CHIpt0VhPV3g/viewform).
> Your employer's GitHub organization will be allowlisted after you do.

## Reporting Issues

We also have an [issues page](https://github.com/aurora-opensource/au/issues) for tracking problems
and future work. If you have a bug report or feature request, check the existing issues to see if
it’s been posted, and file a new one if it hasn’t. While we can’t promise timely resolution, we will
do our best to respond quickly so you know you’ve been heard, and where we stand on the issue.

## License

By contributing to Au, you agree to be bound by the terms of the applicable CLA and that your
contributions will be licensed under the LICENSE file in the root directory of this source tree.

## Guidelines for Pull Requests

Pull requests (PRs) can involve a significant amount of work, both to
write and to review.  Follow these guidelines to minimize the chance of wasting that work, and
maximize the chance of delivering its value!

- First, **check the [issues](https://github.com/aurora-opensource/au/issues)**.  If your change
  isn't covered by any existing issue, it's a good idea to file a new one, so you can make sure the
  change would be welcomed.

- Make **small PRs**.  Each PR should address **one idea only**.  This means some issues may take
  multiple PRs to resolve; this is normal and expected.

- Each PR becomes one single commit when it lands to main, so follow the rules for [good commit
  messages](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/)!  In particular, note that the PR title becomes the commit
  title, and the PR summary becomes the commit body.

- All remote builds must pass before any PR is landed.

See our [development setup guide](https://aurora-opensource.github.io/au/develop/) to get started
with building and testing the code and documentation!
