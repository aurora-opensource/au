# Ignore `cmake/` to prevent Bazel from finding BUILD files in `cmake/build/`
# (created by CMake builds with FetchContent dependencies like `googletest`).
#
# NOTE: `.bazelignore` only works when Au is the main workspace (i.e., local
# development).  Users who depend on Au via bzlmod should not encounter this
# issue, because Bazel fetches a fresh copy of the repo without `cmake/build/`.
# In the unlikely event that a user does encounter this issue, they can add
# the appropriate path to their own `.bazelignore` file.
