# Au Idioms

This section covers common idioms and usage patterns you'll encounter in using Au.  These concepts
can make you more effective with this library, but may not help with other units libraries.

- **[Unit slots](./unit-slots.md)**.  Many Au APIs have parameters that accept an explicitly named
  unit.  We call these paremeters "unit slots".  This page will explain what kinds of things can go
  in that slot, and which ones to prefer in different situations.
