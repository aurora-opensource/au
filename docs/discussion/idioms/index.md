# Au Idioms

This section covers common idioms and usage patterns you'll encounter in using Au.  These concepts
can make you more effective with this library, but may not help with other units libraries.

- **[Unit expression APIs](./unit-expression-api.md)**.  Many Au APIs have parameters that accept
  a "unit expression".  This page will explain what that is, what kinds of things can go in that
  slot, and which ones to prefer.
