# Discussion Docs

This section is for docs that illuminate Au's underpinnings.  The kinds of docs that go here include
philosophy and principles, deep dives on design choices, explanations of core concepts, and more.

In terms of the [four categories of documentation](https://documentation.divio.com/) --- which we
try to follow --- this is also known as
"[explanation](https://documentation.divio.com/explanation/)".  It's most useful when you're
**studying**, rather than working, and it focuses on **theoretical** rather than practical
knowledge.

Here's a guide to the main categories.

- **[Au Idioms](./idioms/index.md).**  Usage patterns that are more specific to Au, and can help you
  get the most out of it.

- **[Generic concepts](./concepts/index.md).**  Ideas that can enhance your effectiveness in working
  with any units library, or with quantities generally.

- **[Implementation details](./implementation/index.md).**  Concepts and design discussions that
  help you understand _how_ we made Au.  These are less likely to directly make you a more effective
  user, but they may be of interest for the curious.
