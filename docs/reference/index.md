# Reference Docs

This section contains detailed reference documentation on `Quantity`, `QuantityPoint`, units,
dimensions, magnitudes, and other core library abstractions.  The main folder is reserved for things
that end users will routinely interact with.  Implementation details will be documented in
a `detail` sub-folder.
