# Au documentation

Welcome to the Au library!  Au (pronounced "ay yoo") is a C++14-compatible units library, by
[Aurora](https://aurora.tech/).  Its key strengths include safety, accessibility, performance, and
developer experience.

## Getting started

These pages will be most useful as you begin your Au journey.

- **[Alternatives](./alternatives/index.md).**  First off: is Au the right fit for _your_ needs?
  What else is out there?  This page gives a detailed comparison to some of the most prominent other
  C++ units libraries.

- **[Installation](./install.md).**  Once you're ready to try it out, here's how.  You can be up and
  running in any project within minutes!

- **[Tutorials](./tutorial/index.md).**  Start with [Au 101: Quantity
  Makers](./tutorial/101-quantity-makers.md), and go forward from there.  You'll learn the basic
  library concepts, and get some hands on experience with the included exercises.

## Continuing your journey

Once you're up and running with the library, these pages will be handy tools to help you use it more
effectively.

- **[Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.md).**  A guide to the most commonly encountered types of
  error, what they mean, and how to fix them.  Take key snippets from your compiler errors, and
  use in-page search to get help!

- **[How-to guides](./howto/index.md).**  Detailed instructions for common tasks you may encounter
  in using the library.

## Planned future content

While Au has had plenty of production experience internally at Aurora, its life as a public open
source library is just beginning.  Here are some sections we know we'll need to add.

- **Reference.**  Detailed reference documentation on `Quantity`, `QuantityPoint`, units,
  magnitudes, and other core library abstractions.

- **Explanation.**  There's plenty we'd love to share about the design choices that underpin the
  library. While launching Au, we've de-prioritized this section in favor of the more directly
  practical parts --- but while it may be less _urgent_, it's no less _important_.
