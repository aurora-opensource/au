# Comparison of Alternatives

There are plenty of other open source C++ units libraries, many quite well established.  However,
the tradeoffs required to use these libraries can be so significant that many people can't or won't
use them.  For example: the compiler errors may be inscrutable or overwhelming; the compilation
process may become unacceptably slow; or, the required C++ standard may simply be too new for
a user.

Au is an accessible, production-tested alternative.  We provide a number of rare or outright novel
features, with a small compile time footprint --- and we're compatible with every C++ version back
to the mature and widely available C++14 standard. Key features include:

- Fully unit-safe APIs, on both entry and exit.
- The "safety surface": conversions that adapt to the overflow risk based on both conversion
  magnitude, and storage type.
- Highly composable "quantity maker" APIs make it easy to both compose new units, and apply unit
  prefixes, on the fly.
- Human-readable and concise compiler errors, via strong typenames for units.
- The `Zero` type: novel, fluent handling of construction, comparison, and sign handling for
  quantities.
- Ease of migration (both to and from Au): with minimal setup, we support bidirectional implicit
  conversions with equivalent types from any other units library.
- Support for single-header-file delivery, but with easy customization of units and features to
  include.
- Proven track record supporting embedded applications as first class citizens, via such features as
  our safe handling of integer Rep, treating all Reps on equal footing, and our easy ability to
  exclude expensive `<iostream>` support.
- Intelligent, unit-aware functions for rounding and computing inverses.
- Minimal friction by using a single, short namespace: everything's in `au::`.

## Detailed comparison matrices

Here's a more detailed comparison to the most prominent alternatives.  We'll use the following

these traditional color schemes have poor accessibility for colorblind readers.  The present color
scheme was designed to be colorblind-friendly.

### Obtaining the library

These are the first criteria to consider.  They will tell you whether you can even use the library
at all, and if so, how hard it will be to obtain.

!!! note
    These ratings are written with **all** users and projects in mind.  Keep in mind that what
    matters for _you_ is **your** project.

    For example: mp-units gets low accessibility ratings because of its steep C++20 minimum
    requirement, and its dependence on a package manager to make the installation easy.  However, if
    your project is _already_ compatible with C++20, and _already_ uses conan, then these "low"
    ratings would be completely irrelevant for you.

### Generic developer experience

Next: how will this library change the generic developer experience?  Leaving aside any library
features, conventions, or implementation strategies, there are two main impacts to developer
experience.

1. Your program will take **longer to compile**, because the compiler is doing more work to produce
   essentially the same program.

2. You will get **more compiler errors** that developers will need to understand and fix.

These costs can bring significant benefits, but we still want them to be as small as possible.

### Library features

At this point, you've assessed:

- whether you can use each library at all;
- how hard it will be to add to your project;
- and, what costs you'll pay in developer experience if you do.

Now we're ready to compare the libraries "as units libraries" --- that is, in terms of their core
features.
